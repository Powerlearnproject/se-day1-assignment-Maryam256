Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
* Software engineering is a field in computer science that focuses on systematic design, development, testing and maintainance of software applications. It is essential in the technology industry because it ensures that software is of high quality, scalable, cost effective and user friendly to drive innovation and competitive advantage while providing approaches to project management and collaboration. It also enables the creation of software applications that power various aspects of modern life i.e., communication, commerce and entertainment.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* The development of programming Languages eg Fotran.
* The establishment of software engineering as a  discipline in 1960s.
* Rise of Agile technologies in 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
* Requirements which include gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
* Design by creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
* Implementation through writing codes and building the software according to the design specifications.
* Conducting various tests software meets standard quality and functional requirements.
* Deployment by releasing software to users and customers.
* Maintainance through providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
* Waterfall offer limited flexibility between phases making it challenging to incorporate changes once a phase is completed where as Agile provides high flexibility between iterations enabling frequent adjusstments based on evolving requirements.
* Waterfall is characterised by a linear approach between distinct phases where each phase is completed before moving to the next where as Agile employs an iterative approach between overlapping cycles allowing continuous development and adjustments.
* In waterfall, there is a clear demarcation between phases such as requirements, design and testing with each phase following a strict sequence while in Agile the phases of planning, development and testing overlap between iteration creating an intergrated cycle between these activities.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
* Software Developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
* Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
* Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
* Intergrated Development Environments are used to oversee the planning, execution and delivery of software projects which include visual studio, Eclipse.
* Version Control Systems used to track changes to source code and cordinating work among members for example Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
* Change in requirements during the development cycle, leading to project delays which can be overcome by adopting Agile frame works like Scrum that embrace iterative development for regular reassessment of requirements and intergration of changes in short cycles.
* Pressure to deliver software products on time which can result to rushed development and compromised quality which can be solved by using well defined change management process to manage scope changes and avoid adding new features in the development cycle that could compromise the quality.
* Accrued from shortcuts technical debt that can impede future development efforts and increase maintainance costs which can be solved by regular assessing of document instances of technical desbt with in codebase.
  
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
* Unit testing involves individdual components of code in isolation from the rest of the application to ensure that each unit of the software performs as expected. It is important because it identifies bugs and issues at the earlist stage of development making them easier and cheaper to fix.
* Intergration testing involves testing the interactions and interfaces between different modules of the software to ensure that combined components work together as intended. It is important because it confirms that different components interact correctly and also ensure data is correctly passed between modules and processed without error. 
* System testing involves testing the completre and intergrated software as a whole to ensure that it meets the specified requirements. It is important because it validates the end to end functionality of the system ensuring that all features work together as intended.
* Acceptance testing involves testing the software to ensure it meets the business reqquirements and is ready for deployment. It is important because the software meets the end users' needs and satisfies theier requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
* Prompt engineering is a specialised field which focuses on designing and optimizing prompts to elicit desired responses from AI models particularly language models like GPT-3. 
* They can help in obtaining consistent results across different interactions leading to more reliable outcomes.
* Proper Prompt designs help in minimizing the chances of misinterpretations by providing clear and specific instructions to the AI.
* Facilitates the adaptation of AI models for domain specific applications by designing prompts that address industry specific needs and contexts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
* "Tell me about the environment."
  Improved prompt
  *"Provide a summary of the main environmental issues affecting urban areas today"
  * The improved prompt identifies what aspects of environment is being talked about.
  * It is direct to the point focusing on essential elements that need to be covered in response without unnecessary elaboration.
  * The improved prompt directly addresses the user's need for information about urban environment issues.
  * It reduces likelihood of requiring followup clarifications which makes the interaction more efficient and less prone to back and forth exchanges.
